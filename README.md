# NotePlus (Final app after blog)

## Blog link: 

A **single user** flutter notes app for GraphQL + Flutter Blog.

This application does not have much purpose, it is only for explaining the concepts in the blog.

## Setup:

### **Download skeleton app**
- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) the repo (skeleton branch).

### **Get packages**

After cloning the skeleton project, we need to install all required packages.
- Open a terminal at the root of the project.
- Run the following command to get all packages from ***pubspec.yaml***
```
flutter pub get
``` 
#### Now you can run the app.
